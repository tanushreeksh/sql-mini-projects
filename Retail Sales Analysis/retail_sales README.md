# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Retail Sales Analysis  
**Level**: Beginner  
**Database**: `proj_p1`

This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and answering specific business questions through SQL queries.

## Objectives

1. **Set up a retail sales database**: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**: The project starts by creating a database named `proj_p1`.
- **Table Creation**: A table named `retail_sales` is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for transaction ID, sale date, sale time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and total sale amount.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE proj_p1;

CREATE TABLE retail_sales(
		transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
		sale_date DATE,
		sale_time TIME,
		customer_id INT,
		gender VARCHAR(20),
		age INT,
		category VARCHAR(50),
		quantity INT,
		price_per_unit FLOAT,
		cogs FLOAT,
		total_sale FLOAT
);
```

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

- **Record Count**: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
- **Customer Count**: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.
- **Category Count**: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.
- **Null Value Check**: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.

**Note** - A small number of records contain missing values in the ***age*** column. Since the analysis does not involve age-based filtering or aggregation, these records were not removed.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS records
FROM retail_sales;

SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE transaction_id IS NULL
OR sale_date IS NULL
OR sale_time IS NULL
OR customer_id IS NULL
OR gender IS NULL
OR age IS NULL
OR category IS NULL
OR quantity IS NULL
OR price_per_unit IS NULL
OR cogs IS NULL
OR total_sale IS NULL;


-- Data Cleaning
DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date IS NULL
OR sale_time IS NULL
OR customer_id IS NULL
OR gender IS NULL
OR category IS NULL
OR quantity IS NULL
OR price_per_unit IS NULL
OR cogs IS NULL
OR total_sale IS NULL;


--Data Exploration

-- How many unique customers do we have?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(customer_id)) AS unique_customers
FROM retail_sales;

-- What categories do we have?
SELECT DISTINCT category
FROM retail_sales;
```

### 3. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions:

1. **Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';
```


2. **Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Clothing'
	AND TO_CHAR(sale_date,'YYYY-MM') = '2022-11'
	AND quantity >= 4;
```


3. **Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales for each category.**:
```sql
SELECT category,
	SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```


4. **Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.**:
```sql
SELECT category,
	ROUND(AVG(age),0) AS avg_age
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Beauty'
GROUP BY category;
```


5. **Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE total_sale > 1000;
```


6. **Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions made by each gender in each category.**:
```sql
SELECT category,
	gender,
	COUNT(*) AS total_transactions
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category,gender
ORDER BY total_transactions DESC;
```


7. **Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year**:
```sql
SELECT year,month,avg_sales
FROM
(
	SELECT 
		EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) AS year,
		EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS month,
		ROUND(AVG(total_sale)::numeric,2) AS avg_sales,
		RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) AS rank
	FROM retail_sales
	GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date),
		EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date)
) AS t1
WHERE rank = 1;
```


8. **Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales **:
```sql
SELECT customer_id,
	SUM(total_sale) AS spendings
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY spendings DESC
LIMIT 5;
```


9. **Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.**:
```sql
SELECT category,
	COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customers
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
```


10. **Find customers who purchased from every category**
```sql
SELECT customer_id
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT category) = (
	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT category) AS categories
	FROM retail_sales
);
```


11. **Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17)**:
```sql
WITH hourly_sales AS
( 
SELECT *,
	CASE 
		WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
		WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
		ELSE 'Evening'
	END AS shift
FROM retail_sales
)
SELECT shift,
	COUNT(*) AS transactions
FROM hourly_sales
GROUP BY shift
ORDER BY transactions DESC;
```


## Findings

- **Customer Demographics**: The dataset includes customers from various age groups, with sales distributed across different categories such as Clothing , Beauty & Electronics.
- **High-Value Transactions**: Several transactions had a total sale amount greater than 1000, indicating premium purchases.
- **Sales Trends**: Monthly analysis shows variations in sales, helping identify peak seasons.
- **Customer Insights**: The analysis identifies the top-spending customers and the most popular product categories.
