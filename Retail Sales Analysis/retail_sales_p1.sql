--Business Problems 
-- My Analysis & Findings

-- 1. Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on 2022-11-05
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';

-- 2. Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Clothing'
	AND TO_CHAR(sale_date,'YYYY-MM') = '2022-11'
	AND quantity >= 4;


-- 3. Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category
SELECT category,
	SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;


-- 4. Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category
SELECT category,
	ROUND(AVG(age),0) AS avg_age
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Beauty'
GROUP BY category;


-- 5. Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE total_sale > 1000;


-- 6. Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category
SELECT category,
	gender,
	COUNT(*) AS total_transactions
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category,gender
ORDER BY total_transactions DESC;


-- 7. Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year
SELECT year,month,avg_sales
FROM
(
	SELECT 
		EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) AS year,
		EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS month,
		ROUND(AVG(total_sale)::numeric,2) AS avg_sales,
		RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) AS rank
	FROM retail_sales
	GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date),
		EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date)
) AS t1
WHERE rank = 1;


-- 8. Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales 
SELECT customer_id,
	SUM(total_sale) AS spendings
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY spendings DESC 
LIMIT 5;


-- 9. Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category
SELECT category,
	COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customers
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;


-- 10. Find customers who purchased from every category
SELECT customer_id
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT category) = (
	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT category) AS categories
	FROM retail_sales
);


-- 11. Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17)
WITH hourly_sales AS
( 
SELECT *,
	CASE 
		WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
		WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
		ELSE 'Evening'
	END AS shift
FROM retail_sales
)
SELECT shift,
	COUNT(*) AS transactions
FROM hourly_sales
GROUP BY shift

ORDER BY transactions DESC;
